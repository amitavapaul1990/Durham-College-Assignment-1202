# Build Key statistics using python 
In this project we will learn how to get key statistics of a given dataset using python code.
## Description
In this Document, we will learn how to use Python for preprocessing your data when Imported from a csv file. By the end of this document, you will be familiar with basic python function for analyzing your dataset.
### Prerequisites
Before we starting to import the csv file, 
* We need to import our library function and those are Pandas, matplotlib.pyplot & matplotlib using Import command. 
* Since the library function names are large; hence, we will use alias by using ‘as’ key word. 
* For example, in the below, we have imported Pandas library and will use that later in the code with name as ‘pd’.
